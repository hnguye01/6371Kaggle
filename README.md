# Statistical Foundations for Data Science -  Kaggle project (DS6371)
## Introduction 
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or the presence of a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
